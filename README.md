# Personal Portfolio
My personal portfolio. Contains socials and a feed.
Put together in an altogether 3 days.

This repo is open because open-sourcing this doesn't matter to me much. If you'd like to fork it, go ahead!

# Notes & Clarifications
This is my first real GitHub Repo! GitHub even made creating this 3 steps worth of scary looking User Interface!

I get making this public probably isn't helpful to anyone as my design isn't intuitive, but I wanted to release this for a few reasons.

	1: Github Pages allows public repositories to use the feature for free, without an Organization / GitHub Enterprise 
	2: I was testing my web development skills. (please judge my junior developer looking portfolio)
	3: I wanted a portfolio to refer people to what I do!

If I do things frowned upon by the gods of GitHub, please let me know!
